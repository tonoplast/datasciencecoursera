# Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is 
# strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, 
# the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient 
# air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant 
# into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on 
# emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). 
# You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.
# 
# For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 
# were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will 
# use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
