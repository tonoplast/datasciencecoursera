# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" in Week 4.
The script "run_analys.R" will produce a summarised tidy data at the end ("tidy_averaged_data.txt").

The steps are as follows:

1. download the data and unzip
2. looks for all .txt within a given folder (and its subdirectories), lists what we need, and read as tables
3. assigns column names
4. merges the training and test data into one data frame
5. extracts measurements with mean and standard deviations
6. attaches activity labels into the dataset
7. renames variable names
8. summarises (average) by group and outputs the table - tidy_averaged_data.txt

Thank you, and have a good day.
